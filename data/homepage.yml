      content: "Kevin is amazing. He is not just industrious, with great ideas, he is also a very friendly, helpful and
      smart person.[...] But most importantly, Kevin is a jolly fellow, always with a smile, always happy to help, always nice to
      be around."

    - name: "Lorenz Kummer, BSc"
      position: "Research Group Theory and Application of Algorithms, Researcher"
      content: "I have been studying and working with Kevin for the last 4 years 
      at the University of Vienna and i have rarely met people as motivated, capable 
      and reliable as him. Interested in a wide area of fields way beyond the scope 
      of the regular computer sciene curriculum, he is always seeking to improve his 
      knowledge and himself and i have no doubt he will excell at whatever career 
      path he chooses. And last but not least, any testimonial about Kevin that doesnt 
      mention is humor is incomplete: always up for a joke, working with Kevin never gets boring."
